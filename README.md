# Final project - Laetus 

Our group decided to build a cross platform colour detection app, using a brand new framework and language to try and test ourselves and find out how we would fare being faced with an entirely new set of technologies.

#### Requirements
- As we haven't put anything onto either appstore, the only way is to take a copy of the code and use an simulator/emulator.

#### Once ready...
